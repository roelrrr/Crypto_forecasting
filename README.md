# Cryptocurrency Value Prediction
Problem type: Forecasting

## General Context
Forecasting is a technique used to predict future events based on historical data. The quality of these predictions can then be compared to what actually happens. For example, sports and politics betting is a form of forecasting. In this scenario, bettors are paid based on the outcome of their predictions. In its statistical sense, forecasting approaches typically use time series, cross-sectional, or longitudinal data.

## Business Situation
Cryptocurrencies are essentially digital currencies that allow individuals to transact online without the use of traditional financial institutions. The surge in cryptocurrency value and popularity has raised concerns of speculation. But its true application in the real world is still unproven, even for those creating and trading cryptocurrencies.

Just like many other financial assets, the value of cryptocurrencies is particularly volatile and is only worth what someone will pay for it. During the past year, cryptocurrencies lost a significant portion of their value as more regulations are enacted globally. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether became popular because of the lack of regulations on cryptocurrencies in comparison to other financial assets. In particular, financial institutions cannot charge prohibitive fees to transfer funds with cryptocurrencies like a bank can with its traditional payment systems.

Investing in cryptocurrencies can be an exciting new area of finance for many risk-loving investors. In addition to the risks associated with unregulated markets and the lack of regulations that come with this type of investing, investing in cryptocurrencies is particularly challenging, regardless of the knowledge or experience an investor has. Although many individuals understand what Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies are, few have the skills to do proper data-driven trading.

Investments4Some is a long-standing Portuguese, privately-held hedge funds management firm. They use traditional statistical methods and financial indicators to measure the quality of their portfolios. A few years ago, the company begun to explore the usage of Machine Learning models for market price forecasting, but given the lack of maturity of the company in Machine Learning, their newly created department is failing to successfully develop these models and bring them into production.

Investments4Some is aware of the lack of sophistication of the average investor, and is well aware of the potential of Machine Learning methods to anticipate market trends and increase the expected returns of their investments. They know that with a good enough forecasting model, they could more accurately predict market prices and anticipate trends. As such, Warner Buffer and Gil Bates, partners of Investments4Some, have asked you to build them a forecasting model in order to predict the daily value of cryptocurrencies. To do this, you have been provided a dataset containing the daily prices of 10 cryptocurrencies.
